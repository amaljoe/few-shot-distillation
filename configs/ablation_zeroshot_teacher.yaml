# Ablation: 0-shot teacher distillation
#
# Teacher sees ONLY the target question + gold answer (no few-shot examples).
# Isolates whether the gain from distillation is specifically due to few-shot
# context transfer, or simply from any soft-label regularization signal.
#
# If few-shot teacher >> 0-shot teacher, few-shot context is causally responsible.
# If 0-shot teacher ≈ few-shot teacher, gain is from generic soft-label smoothing.
