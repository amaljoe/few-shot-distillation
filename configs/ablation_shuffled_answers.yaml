# Ablation: shuffled-answer exemplars
#
# Teacher sees 8 exemplars but each exemplar's answer is randomly swapped with
# another exemplar's answer (questions are correct, answers are mismatched).
# Tests whether exemplar *content* (specifically correct Q→A correspondences)
# is what drives the gain, vs. merely having extra tokens in context.
#
# If few-shot teacher >> shuffled teacher, correct exemplar content matters.
# If shuffled ≈ few-shot teacher, longer context / token diversity explains gains.
