# Base configuration for Gemma-3-270M full fine-tuning experiments
#
# Uses full fine-tuning (no LoRA) — all parameters updated.
# The 270M model is small enough that full-FT is feasible on A100 80GB.
#
# Architecture: num_layers / hidden_size filled from model.config at runtime.
# These fields are unused by the logit-distillation pipeline but kept for compat.
